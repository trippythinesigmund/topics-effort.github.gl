I made this repository to show the status of my minecraft server with the amount of online players and because I use playit.gg, a program that acts as a tunnel between servers and the internet so people who used to rely on port forwarding (which has many risks)
can switch to playit.gg in order to not port forward, which is a method people use to get a direct connection to servers, but this can allow DDOS attacks. It also is the best free way to get a connection, since other methods like using a VPS, or making your own
DDOS protection is much more lengthy and maybe costy. While there may be free services for VPS, I couldn't find any free ones that do not require credit card information and is in my region.

The site only works for my server, and I used a cloudflare worker so the IP wouldn't be viewable in the HTML code itself, and the cloudflare worker only gave the status of my Minecraft Server giving info such as: Max Player Count, Online Players, Online or Offline.
I have coded everything with AI, but this is just a little project I made so I could atleast understand a bit of what the modern technology has.
